## Quiz Game

This is a multiple-choice quiz game where users are presented with a series of questions and score points based on their correct answers.

### Features:

Randomly generated questions from a pool
Keeps track of user scores
Provides feedback for each answer

### Usage:
1. Run the program and select answers to the presented MCQs.
2. The game displays your score at the end.

## Temperature Converter

A simple C++ program that allows users to input a temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin and converts it to another scale.

### Features:

Supports Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
User input for conversion
Dynamic output for each scale

### Usage:
1. Input a temperature scale and value.
2. Choose the desired scale to convert to.
3. The result is displayed.

## Student Management System

A C++ program that allows you to manage student registrations, records, and grades. It supports adding, editing, and deleting student information dynamically.

### Features:
Add, edit, and delete student records
Calculate grades based on student data
Dynamic memory allocation for student information

### Usage:
1. Add new student records by inputting names, grades, and details.
2. Edit or delete existing records.
3. View calculated grades for each student.

## Data Structures Implementation

This project contains implementations of various data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs. It supports basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Features:

Linked List: Insert, delete, traverse, search
Trees (Binary Search Tree): Insert, delete, traverse, search
Graph: Add edges, depth-first traversal, breadth-first traversal

### Usage:
1. Choose the data structure you want to work with.
2. Select operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) for that data structure.
3. Input data and observe the results dynamically.

## Text-Based Adventure Game

A simple text-based adventure game where the player navigates through different scenarios and makes choices that affect the outcome of the game. Alternatively, a graphical game using SFML or SDL can be developed.

### Features:
Player input for decision-making
Dynamic storyline based on player choices
Scoring based on progress

### Usage:
1. Run the game.
2. Make choices that shape the adventure.
3. See the outcome of your decisions.
